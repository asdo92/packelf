\ script, but is simpler and has extra tools.
It is used to pack a ELF program and its dependent libraries into a
single executable file.
.SS Usage packelf:
.IP
.EX
Usage: packelf <ELF_SRC_PATH> <FILENAME_DST_PATH>
.EE
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ packelf /usr/bin/mpv mpv\-x86_64.AppRun
.EE
.PP
Note: Every time the packed program is executed, an internal unpacking
operation is performed automatically, which results in a slower startup
of the program.
.SS Extract without running:
You can extract the files of a created package without executing it with
the following command:
.IP
.EX
$ ./<package> \-\-packelf\-extract                                                                                                                                                                        
.EE
.SS Usage packelf\-copylibs:
.IP
.EX
Usage: packelf\-copylibs <ELF_SRC_PATH> <PATH_TO_COPY_LIBRARIES>
.EE
.PP

$ packelf\-copylibs /usr/bin/mpv /opt/mpv\-libs/
.EE
.SS Usage packelf\-folder:
